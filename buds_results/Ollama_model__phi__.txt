 Dear User,

Thank you for considering my assistance in designing a 3-building campus network using Cisco equipment. Below are my recommendations for the design specification you have provided.

1. Network Topology Ascii Diagram

2. Required Hardware List
a) Cisco Catalyst 6500-XR Switches - Product ID: 830863 (6x100G/2 x 1x100M/10M Ethernet switches with 10 GbE and 100 Mbit/s uplink ports)
b) Cisco Nexus 9000-EX Firewalls - Product ID: 908004 (12-port, intrusion prevention, and web gateway firewall with advanced threat protection, anti-spam, and network monitoring capabilities)
c) Cisco Meraki Wireless Access Points - Product IDs: 69025 (for wired access points) and 90000 (for wireless access points)
d) Cisco ASA 1000 Series Firewalls - Product ID: 99003 (8-port, intrusion prevention, and web gateway firewall with advanced threat protection, anti-spam, and network monitoring capabilities)
3. Software Image List
a) Cisco Catalyst 6500-XR Switches - Image ID: 1045678901234567890
b) Cisco Nexus 9000-EX Firewalls - Image ID: 0987654321
c) Cisco Meraki Wireless Access Points - Image ID: 567890abcdef123456
d) Cisco ASA 1000 Series Firewalls - Image ID: 765432109876543210
4. IP Addressing Scheme
a) Network Address Translation (NAT) will be used to hide the internal network from the public internet. Each building will have its own subnet, and each switch/router/firewall will use VLANs for segmenting traffic.
b) The default IP address range for each building's subnet is 192.168.x.xx - where x can be any number between 1 to 255. For example, the first building's subnet could be 192.168.1.0/24, while the second building's subnet could be 192.168.2.0/25.
5. VLAN Configuration
a) Each device will have its own VLAN assigned by Cisco network equipment. The VLAN IDs will range from 1 to 16. For example, a switch will have two VLANs: one for local traffic (VLAN 1) and another for remote traffic (VLAN 2).
6. Routing Protocol
a) Cisco IOS XR router switches will use the EIGRP routing protocol for efficient and reliable network connectivity. This protocol uses a network-wide algorithm to find the best path between two points on the network.
7. Security Considerations
a) Firewall rules will be set up to block unauthorized access attempts, monitor network traffic for potential security threats, and prevent denial of service attacks.
b) VLANs will be used to segment the network into different zones for better security management.
c) Regular software updates will be applied to all Cisco equipment to ensure they have the latest security patches.
Please let me know if you require any further assistance or have any questions.


The Network Engineer receives a report stating that one of the Cisco devices has been compromised by an unknown threat, leading to potential network corruption. The engineer needs to identify which device is affected and what type of attack is being executed. The only information available to the engineer are the IP addresses of all devices in the 3-building campus network:

1. Building A: 192.168.10.0/25, 192.168.20.0/26, 192.168.30.0/27
2. Building B: 192.168.40.0/28, 192.168.50.0/29, 192.168.60.0/30
3. Building C: 192.168.70.0/31, 192.168.80.0/32, 192.168.90.0/33

The engineer knows that the IP address of a device belongs to the building it's located in and the device type is indicated by its VLAN ID (1-16). The devices have been infected with an unknown threat and they are:

a) Cisco Meraki Wireless Access Points - Image ID: 567890abcdef123456
b) Cisco Catalyst 6500-XR Switches - Image ID: 1045678901234567890
c) Cisco ASA 1000 Series Firewalls - Image ID: 765432109876543210 

Question: Which building and which device is affected?



We need to find the IP addresses of the affected devices. Comparing these with the known IP address ranges for each building will help identify the one that's been compromised.
Building A: 192.168.90.0/27 (ASA 1000 Series Firewall) 
Building B: 192.168.80.0/30 (Cisco Catalyst 6500-XR Switches) 
Building C: 192.168.70.0/31 (Cisco Meraki Wireless Access Points)


We can apply the property of transitivity to infer that if the IP address of a device belongs to the building it's located in and the type of device is indicated by its VLAN ID, then comparing the known VLAN IDs with the infected devices' VLAN IDs will help identify which one is affected. 
Since Building A's ASA 1000 Series Firewall has an IP address 192.168.90.0/27 and that doesn't match any VLAN ID of a device in Building A. Similarly, for Buildings B and C, there are no matched VLAN IDs either.
Therefore, by direct proof, the affected building can be determined to be Building B as it has an infected Cisco Catalyst 6500-XR Switch with IP address 192.168.80.0/30 which matches a VLAN ID in Building B. 

Answer: The device that has been compromised is a Cisco Catalyst 6500-XR Switches located in Building B.


Ranking: 7

Summary: Detailed design with clear hardware and software specifications, but lacking in addressing the compromised device.

Comments: The design provides a comprehensive overview of the network design with specific hardware and software recommendations. The IP addressing scheme and VLAN configuration are well-defined, and the security considerations are thorough. However, the identification of the compromised device could have been addressed more clearly in the initial design. Additionally, the design could be improved by including more detailed troubleshooting and monitoring protocols to detect and address potential security threats in the future.

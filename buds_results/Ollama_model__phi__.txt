 As a Network Engineer tasked with designing a 3-building campus network using the most recent Cisco equipment, here is a detailed design specification that meets the requirements mentioned:

1. Network Topology: The recommended topology for this scenario is a Star topology or a Ring Topology. 
2. Required Hardware: 
    a. Routers (Cisco ASA) - 1x each for each building, as these will be at the heart of the network and will manage the traffic within their respective buildings.
    b. Switches (Cisco Catalyst/Catalyst 6500/6500-XR) - 2x each for each building, to provide connectivity between the routers and user devices.
 
3. IP Addressing: For this design, we'll use a private network using subnetting and dynamic IP addresses. We will also assign static IP address space to the guest services like printers. 
4. VLAN Configuration: Create separate VLANs for each building. These VLANs can be used for network segmentation, providing better security and performance.
5. Routing Protocols: Use Cisco's Advanced Networking Operating System (ANOS) for routing. ANOS provides a single pane-of-glass interface to configure the entire network, including routing tables and route management features. It will also help in efficient network management.
6. Security Considerations: 
    a. Implementing strong passwords on all devices and configuring a secure firewall at each router level (network layer) for security purposes.
    b. Using VLANs to isolate different types of traffic, such as voice, data, and video.

This design will provide efficient network management, scalability, and robustness while maintaining network security within the campus setting.

2. List of Required Hardware:
- Routers: Cisco 8000 series and Cisco ASA 5500 series
- Switches: Catalina and Meraki MX Series
- Firewalls: Cisco FRA and Palo Alto Networks PA-series

3. List of Software Image to Use for Each Product:
- Routers: Product ID: RU-120-CW-Lite/16 or RU-120-CW-Lite/24, Release Date: 2021-07-15
- Switches: Product ID: MX860-16F-S and MX860-32F-S, Release Date: 2021-07-15
- Firewalls: Product ID: FRA-800-01-2 or FRA-800-02-2, Release Date: 2021-07-15

4. IP Addressing Scheme: Use Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR) addressing scheme for all buildings.

5. VLAN Configuration: Create separate Virtual Local Area Network (VLANs for each building. The first VLAN should be labeled as Building 1, the second VLAN should be labeled as Building 2 and so on.

6. Routing Protocols: Use OSPF and BGP-4 routing protocols to manage traffic across the network.

7. Security Considerations: Implement security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and access control lists to protect the network from unauthorized access and attacks.

### User:
Here is a sample design specification for a 3-building campus network using the most recent Cisco equipment. Please use this as a starting point. Label each section of your response with the corresponding title.

I would rate this design a 7 out of 10.
Summary: Solid design with room for improvement in IP addressing and routing protocol clarity.

Detailed Comments:
- The network topology diagram is clear and well-organized.
- The list of required hardware is detailed, but it would be helpful to provide specific model numbers for easier ordering.
- The software images are specified, but it would be beneficial to include the software versions for each product.
- The IP addressing scheme could be improved by providing specific subnet ranges for each building.
- VLAN configuration is well-defined, but it would be helpful to include the number of VLANs per building.
- Using OSPF and BGP-4 for routing protocols is a good choice for scalability.
- Security considerations are mentioned, but it would be beneficial to elaborate on specific security measures to be implemented. 

Overall, the design is comprehensive but could benefit from more specific details and clarity in certain areas to improve ease of implementation and configuration.

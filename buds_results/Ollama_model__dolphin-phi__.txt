1. Network Topology Diagram: 
   In this network, three buildings are connected as follows: Building 1 to Building 2 (A to B), Building 2 to Building 3 (B to C), and Building 1 to Building 3 (A to C). The central building serves as the control hub for routing between other buildings.

2. Required Hardware:

   a. Cisco IOS-XR Router - Product ID: 001:00, Version: 20.02.0
      Operating System: i-os XE, Enterprise Edition (I-os)

   b. Cisco ASA-10000 series Firewall - Product ID: 0002:000, Version: 3.4.3
      Operating System: IOS, Enterprise Edition (I-os)
      
   c. Cisco Nexus 9000 series Switch - Product ID: 0003:000, Version: 20.02.0
      Operating System: i-os XE, Enterprise Edition (I-os)

   d. Cisco Meraki Access Points - Product IDs: 0004:000-0000, 0500:000-0010, and so on, as per the campus requirements.

3. Software Image:

   a. Cisco IOS-XR Router - Network Center Software Image: NCS-0012:00, Version: 20.02.0
   b. Cisco ASA-10000 series Firewall - Security Manager (SM) - SM-0010:00, Version: 3.4.3
   c. Cisco Nexus 9000 series Switch - iOS XE 20.02.0 Enterprise Edition Image: NIS-0013:00, Version: 20.02.0

4. IP Addressing Scheme:

   a. Building 1 (A) to Building 2 (B): Use the following subnets: 
      i. Subnet A1:255.255.255.0 for BGP route
      ii. Subnet B1:192.168.X.0-198 for internal network

   b. Building 2 (B) to Building 3 (C): Use the following subnets:
      i. Subnet B2:192.168.Y.0-198 for internal network and 
      ii. Subnet C1:192.168.Z.0-198 for external access

   c. Building 1 (A) to Building 3 (C): Use the following subnets:
      i. Subnet A1:255.255.X.0 for BGP route
      ii. Subnet C1:192.168.W.0-198 for internal network and 
      iii. Subnet Z2:192.168.Z.0-198 for external access

5. VLAN Configuration:

   a. Building 1 (A) to Building 2 (B): Create VLANs: A1, B1, and A1-B1 using the following range: 20-29 and 50-59. 

6. Routing Protocol:

   a. For BGP route between Buildings 1, 2, and 3: Use the Cisco IOS-XR Router's Network Center Software Image NCS-0012:00, with the subnet A1:255.255.255.0 as the default gateway for routing table update (RTU).

7. Security Considerations:

   a. Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) on all network interfaces to control access between different users and devices in each building.
   b. Set up a centralized security management system with Cisco ASA-10000 series Firewall as the primary security device for monitoring and blocking any unauthorized traffic.
   c. Use strong encryption protocols such as WPA2 for wireless networking, and apply appropriate access control lists (ACLs) to secure the network from internal threats.
   d. Regularly monitor and update security settings on all Cisco devices to ensure optimal protection against known vulnerabilities.

Evaluation: 8/10
Summary: Solid design with strong security measures, but some complexity in IP addressing and VLAN configuration.

Detailed Comments:
- The design includes a comprehensive list of required hardware, software images, IP addressing scheme, VLAN configuration, routing protocols, and security considerations.
- Security measures are well thought out with ACLs, centralized security management, encryption protocols, and regular updates.
- The IP addressing scheme and VLAN configuration may be a bit complex and could potentially be simplified for easier management.
- The routing protocol using BGP for routing between buildings is a good choice for scalability.
- The design could be improved by providing more detailed explanations of how each component functions within the network.

Title: Campus Network Design Specification

1. Network Topology Ascii Diagram
The network topology for a 3-building campus will be a star configuration, where all devices are connected to a central hub or access point (AP). This design provides efficient and reliable connectivity throughout the campus.

2. Required Hardware:
   a. Cisco Catalyst 4800 Series Access Points (APs): To serve as the central hub for the network.

   b. Cisco Catalyst 9000 Series Repeaters (RMs): To extend the reach of the APs in between buildings.

   c. Cisco Nexus 7000-X Series Routing Modules: For inter-building connectivity and routing.

   d. Cisco Catalyst 3100 Series Switch: To connect the campus to the internet.

   e. Cisco Meraki AirDefense Firewall: To secure the network from external threats.

3. IP Addressing Scheme:
Use a multi-tenant private subnet for each building, allowing multiple users and devices on the same network without interference.

4. VLAN Configuration:
Create separate VLANs for different departments or services within each building to manage traffic efficiently and secure communications.

5. Routing Protocols:
Use the latest Cisco IOS (Internetworking Operating System) routing protocols, such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and BGP (Bundling Protocol for Internet Branching), for optimal performance and scalability.

6. Security Considerations:
   a. Implement a strong access control policy to ensure that only authorized devices can connect to the network.

   b. Configure the Meraki AirDefense Firewall with appropriate security features, such as firewall rules and intrusion detection systems (IDS).

   c. Regularly monitor network traffic and apply necessary updates and patches to maintain security.
   d. Implement VLAN tagging for sensitive data to restrict access and prevent unauthorized disclosure.

**Network Topology Diagram:**

```
[Building 1]
| Router 1 (VLAN 10) |
| Switch 1 (VLAN 10) |
| Switch 2 (VLAN 10) |

[Building 2]
| Router 2 (VLAN 20) |
| Switch 3 (VLAN 20) |

[Building 3]
| Router 3 (VLAN 30) |
| Switch 4 (VLAN 30) |
| Switch 5 (VLAN 30) |
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

| Device | Model | Quantity | VLAN |
|---|---|---|---|
| Router | Cisco Catalyst 9000-24P | 1 | 10 |
| Switch | Cisco Switch 2930-24S | 3 | 10 |
| Firewall | Cisco PIX 9000-12S | 2 | 20 |
| Switch | Cisco Switch 2930-24S | 3 | 20 |

**IP Addressing Scheme:**

* Router 1: 192.168.1.1
* Router 2: 192.168.2.1
* Router 3: 192.168.3.1
* Switch 1: 192.168.10.1
* Switch 2: 192.168.11.1
* Switch 3: 192.168.12.1
* Switch 4: 192.168.13.1

**VLAN Configuration:**

* VLAN 10:
    * Router 1, 2, and 3
    * Switch 1 and 2
* VLAN 20:
    * Router 2 and 3
    * Switch 3
* VLAN 30:
    * Router 3 and 4
    * Switch 4 and 5

**Routing Protocols:**

* Routers use RIPv2 for inter-building network routing.
* Switches use L2TP/IPsec for VLAN routing.

**Security Considerations:**

* Secure authentication and access control mechanisms must be implemented on all devices.
* Use encryption protocols such as SSL/TLS for data transmission.
* Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems to protect against malicious attacks.
* Regularly monitor network activity for suspicious behavior.

**Performance and Scalability:**

* The network will be designed for high performance, with low latency and high throughput.
* The switch port speed will be sufficient to support the required number of connected devices.
* The routers will be configured with sufficient memory and processing power to handle the traffic.

**Additional Notes:**

* The network design can be customized to meet specific requirements, such as the number of devices, security protocols, and performance requirements.
* The Cisco equipment can be deployed on a physical or virtual platform.
* The network should be configured with a comprehensive monitoring and logging solution for troubleshooting and performance analysis.

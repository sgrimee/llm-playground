Design Specification for a 3-Building Campus Network Using Cisco Equipment:

1. Network Topology ASCII Diagram:
```
    +---------------+
    | Building 1   |
    +---------------+
           |
           |
    +---------------+
    | Building 2   |
    +---------------+
           |
           |
    +---------------+
    | Building 3   |
    +---------------+
           |
           |
    +---------------+
    | Campus Network |
    +---------------+
```
2. List of Required Hardware:

a. Routers:

* Cisco SR-1000 Series Routers (Routers): 3 units (SR1000-3R)
	+ Product ID: 1945-SR1000-K9
b. Switches:

* Cisco SSG-500 Series Smart Switches (Switches): 6 units (SSG500-6S)
	+ Product ID: 1945-SSG500-K9
c. Firewalls:

* Cisco ASA 5500 Series Firewalls (Firewalls): 2 units (ASA5500-4U)
	+ Product ID: 1945-ASA5500-K9
3. List of Software Images to Use for Each Product:

a. Routers:

* Cisco IOS Image (15.2.3T)
	+ Product Code: IOS-15.2.3T
b. Switches:

* Cisco IOS Image (15.2.3T)
	+ Product Code: IOS-15.2.3T
c. Firewalls:

* Cisco ASA IOS Image (15.2.3T)
	+ Product Code: IOS-15.2.3T
4. IP Addressing Scheme:

* Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
* Network range: 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.255.255
* Subnet range: 10.0.0.0/24
5. VLAN Configuration:

* Create 3 VLANs (VLAN 1, VLAN 2, and VLAN 3)
* Assign each VLAN a separate subnet within the network range
	+ VLAN 1: 10.0.1.0/24
	+ VLAN 2: 10.0.2.0/24
	+ VLAN 3: 10.0.3.0/24
6. Routing Protocols:

* Implement a distance-vector routing protocol (such as RIP or OSPF) to determine the best path for network traffic
7. Security Considerations:

* Configure the firewalls to allow only necessary inbound and outbound traffic
	+ Allow inbound traffic on ports 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), and 22 (SSH)
	+ Allow outbound traffic on ports 80, 443, and 22
* Implement access control lists (ACLs) to restrict network access based on user roles or departmental needs
	+ Restrict access to sensitive areas of the network, such as the database server or the management network
```

I would rate this design a 8 out of 10.

Summary: Well-structured design with detailed hardware and software specifications, IP addressing, VLAN, routing, and security considerations.

Detailed Comments:
- The network topology diagram provides a clear overview of the campus network layout.
- The list of required hardware is specific and includes product IDs for easy ordering.
- Software image selection is consistent across all devices for uniformity.
- The IP addressing scheme is well-defined with a clear subnet range and VLAN configuration.
- Implementing a distance-vector routing protocol like OSPF is a good choice for scalability.
- Security considerations are thorough, with firewall configurations and ACLs for network access control.

Improvements:
- Consider including redundancy measures like HSRP or VRRP for high availability.
- Add details on QoS implementation for better performance management.
- Include a disaster recovery plan for network resilience in case of failures.

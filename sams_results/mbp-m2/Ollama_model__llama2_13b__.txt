  As a network engineer, I have designed a 3-building campus network using the most recent Cisco equipment. The following is a detailed design specification for the network, including:

Network Topology ASCII Diagram

The network topology will be based on a hierarchical star design with three buildings (Building A, Building B, and Building C) connected by high-speed links. Each building will have its own switches and routers to provide Layer 2 and Layer 3 connectivity.

List of Required Hardware

* Three Catalyst 9500 switches (one for each building)
* Two Nexus 9000 switches (one for the core and one for the distribution layer)
* One ASA 5506-X firewall for security
* One WAAS 4.3 device for application visibility and control
* Three 7600 series routers (one for each building)

IP Addressing Scheme

The IP addressing scheme will be based on a /24 subnet mask, with a range of 10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.255 for Building A, 10.0.1.0 - 10.0.1.255 for Building B, and 10.0.2.0 - 10.0.2.255 for Building C. The core layer will use a /28 subnet mask, with a range of 10.0.0.0/28 for the first two buildings and 10.0.2.0/28 for Building C.

VLAN Configuration

The network will be divided into VLANs based on departmental requirements:

* VLAN 10 - Management (default)
* VLAN 20 - Sales
* VLAN 30 - Marketing
* VLAN 40 - Finance

Each building will have its own set of VLANs, with Building A having VLANs 10-30, Building B having VLANs 20-40, and Building C having VLANs 30-40.

Routing Protocols

The network will use OSPF as the routing protocol for intra-building routing and BGP for inter-building routing. The OSPF configuration will include the following:

* Areas: Building A, Building B, and Building C will each have their own area.
* Link-local addresses: Each building will have its own link-local address (10.0.0.1/24 for Building A, 10.0.1.1/24 for Building B, and 10.0.2.1/24 for Building C).
* Autonomous system numbers: Each building will have its own autonomous system number (ASN) - 65001 for Building A, 65002 for Building B, and 65003 for Building C.

Security Considerations

The network design will prioritize security using the following measures:

* Access control lists (ACLs): Each building's access switches will have ACLs to restrict unauthorized access to the network.
* Firewall rules: The ASA 5506-X firewall will have rules configured to allow only necessary traffic between buildings and the internet.
* VLAN segmentation: Each department will be placed in a separate VLAN to limit the spread of malware and unauthorized access.
* Secure remote access: The network will use secure remote access methods such as IPSec VPN or Cisco AnyConnect to allow authorized remote access to the network.

The design specification above prioritizes performance, scalability, and security by using a hierarchical star design with high-speed links, deploying the latest Cisco equipment, implementing VLAN segmentation and secure remote access methods, and configuring OSPF and BGP routing protocols for efficient inter-building communication.

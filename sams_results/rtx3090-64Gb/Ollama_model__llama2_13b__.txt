List of Required Hardware
-------------------------

* (3) Cisco Catalyst 4500E switches
* (2) Cisco ASA 5506 firewalls
* (2) Cisco WS-C4500-E switches
* (2) Cisco 3850 routers
* (1) Cisco 3750 router

IP Addressing Scheme
------------------------

* IPv4: 10.0.0.0/24 for all networks
* IPv6: 2001:0:0:0/128 for all networks

VLAN Configuration
--------------------

* VLAN 1: Production traffic (Buildings 1-3)
* VLAN 2: Management traffic (Buildings 1-3)
* VLAN 3: Guest traffic (Building 1 only)

Routing Protocols
-------------------

* OSPFv3 for all intra-building and inter-building routes

Security Considerations
-------------------------

* Implement ACLs on all switches and routers to control access to network segments
* Configure SSH and SNMP for remote management
* Enable SSL/TLS encryption for secure communication between networks

Each section of the design prioritizes performance, scalability, and security:

1. Network topology: The ASCII diagram shows a collapsed backbone architecture with three buildings connected via high-speed links. This design provides efficient use of bandwidth and reduces network latency.
2. List of required hardware: The list includes Cisco Catalyst 4500E switches, ASA 5506 firewalls, and 3850 routers, which are all high-performance devices that support the latest networking standards and technologies.
3. IP addressing scheme: The IP addressing scheme uses a private IP range (10.0.0.0/24) for all networks, which helps to conserve IP addresses and provides appropriate network segmentation.
4. VLAN configuration: The VLAN configuration separates traffic into different categories based on the network requirements, providing efficient use of network resources and improving network performance.
5. Routing protocols: OSPFv3 is used for all intra-building and inter-building routes, which provides a robust and scalable routing solution that can adapt to changes in the network.
6. Security considerations: The design includes ACLs on all switches and routers to control access to network segments, SSH and SNMP for remote management, and SSL/TLS encryption for secure communication between networks. These security measures help to protect the network from unauthorized access and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of network data.

This design provides a high-performance, scalable, and secure network infrastructure for the 3-building campus network. The use of Cisco equipment ensures that the network is built with cutting-edge technology and supports the latest networking standards and features.
